# Octanew-OS
A very basic operating system that can be easily manipulated.
If you want try the operating system for yourself, go to the OctanewOS.bat file > raw > copy > open notepad, and copy-paste the code > file > save as > save the file as anything with the bat extention > open the program.
If you have basic coding knowlage of Batch, then you should be able to have some fun with the backend of this operating system, very skin and bones.

If you want the most fun time editing and changing the code, for ease of use, I recommend version 1.1.
