# Octanew-OS
A very basic operating system that can be easily manipulated.
If you want to try the operating system for yourself, go to the OctanewOS.bat file > raw > copy > open notepad, and copy-paste the code > file > save as > save the file as anything with the .bat extension> open the program.
If you have basic coding knowledge of Batch, then you should be able to have some fun with the backend of this operating system, very skin and bones.


If you want the most fun time editing and changing the code, for ease of use, I recommend version 1.1.

# Future Updates

Have a more user-friendly design

Be able to fix everything from the front end
