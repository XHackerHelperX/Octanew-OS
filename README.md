# Octanew-OS
A very basic operating system that can be easily manipulated.
If you want to try the operating system for yourself, go to the OctanewOS.bat file > raw > copy > open notepad, and copy-paste the code > file > save as > save the file as anything with the .bat extension> open the program.
If you have basic coding knowledge of Batch, then you should be able to have some fun with the backend of this operating system, very skin and bones.

With the coming of version 1.6, this OS will be much more like a virtual machine. You will allocate a directory to place all of the system files and create a login/ account. It will all still run in batch and in the command line, but I want it to look nicer in the future.

If you want the most fun time editing and changing the code, for ease of use, I recommend version 1.1.

# Future Updates

It will have a fancy loading screen (Unsure of what that will look like)

Have a more user-friendly design

Be able to fix everything from the front end (similar to Arch Linux)
